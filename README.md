[Link to the website](https://donovan-herion.github.io/tribute-page/)

This tribute page is the very first website that I made using HTML and CSS.

This project is also the first one I pushed on github using the command line.

I kinda struggled to get my computer set up with everything i need for the command line (git bash, unix, ...)

After setting everything up I used cmder to push this folder on github following brad's from traversy media advices.
